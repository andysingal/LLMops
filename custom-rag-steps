Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Design the Retrieval Pipeline

- Choose a vector database such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS for semantic search.

- Create embeddings with models like OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or Sentence Transformers.

2. Develop the MCP Server

- Use lightweight, high-performance frameworks such as FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js).

- Implement endpoints for retrieval queries, context injection, and auth layers.

3. Integrate AI Models

- Connect to APIs from OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude, or Meta LLaMA.

- Ensure prompt construction logic dynamically inserts retrieved context before the user’s request.

4. Optimize Context Windows

- Apply chunking techniques (LangChain text splitter) to divide large documents into manageable segments.

- Use embedding-based ranking to select only the most relevant chunks within token limits.

5. Implement Feedback & Continuous Learning

- Store AI outputs and user feedback in a logging pipeline (Prometheus or Elastic Stack).

- Continuously retrain retrieval indexes for up-to-date project knowledge.

### Advantages of a Custom RAG MCP Server
- Reduced hallucinations through fact-grounded answers.

- Faster coding cycles by serving AI with instant, relevant context.

- Scalability — handle millions of documents without slowing queries.

- Security — keep proprietary codebases private, unlike public LLM fine-tuning.
