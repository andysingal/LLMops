[5 Best LLM Gateways for Scaling AI Applications in 2025](https://dev.to/kuldeep_paul/5-best-llm-gateways-for-scaling-ai-applications-in-2025-1jmh)
Selection Criteria for the Best LLM Gateways
When evaluating LLM gateways, technical leaders should consider:

- Performance: Latency, throughput, and intelligent routing capabilities.
- Scalability: Support for high-volume, production-grade workloads.
- Integration: Compatibility with popular frameworks and ease of setup.
- Observability: Built-in monitoring, tracing, and quality evaluation tools.
- Security and Compliance: Enterprise-grade policies and data protection.
- Flexibility: Multi-provider support, plugin architecture, and deployment options.



#### Scalability & Serving in LLMs

Running an LLM in production is very different from experimenting locally. When thousands (or millions) of users send requests, the system must scale reliably. This requires model serving frameworks and load balancing strategies.

 Model Serving Frameworks

 1. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server

→ Supports multiple frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.)
→ Optimized for GPUs, making it ideal for high-performance LLM serving
→ Provides features like dynamic batching, model versioning, and multi-model deployment

Use case: Deploying LLMs at scale in GPU clusters with minimal latency.

 2. TorchServe

→ Built for serving PyTorch models in production
→ Offers model packaging, RESTful APIs, and logging out of the box
→ Good for teams heavily invested in the PyTorch ecosystem

Use case: Deploying smaller or mid-sized LLMs with flexible customization.

 3. Other Options

✓ Ray Serve → scales across clusters, supports distributed inference
✓ TensorFlow Serving → production-ready if models are TensorFlow-based

 Load Balancing

Even with strong serving frameworks, one server cannot handle all requests. Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

 Strategies

✓ Round Robin: Requests distributed evenly across servers
✓ Least Connections: Direct requests to servers with the fewest active connections
✓ Weighted Balancing: Some servers handle more load depending on capacity
✓ Geographic Balancing: Route users to the closest data center for low latency

 Scaling Approaches

→ Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers/nodes to handle increased traffic
→ Vertical Scaling: Increase compute power (e.g., more GPUs, RAM) of existing servers
→ Autoscaling: Automatically spin up/down instances based on demand

 Why It Matters

LLMs are resource-intensive. Without scalability strategies, even the best model will fail under real-world traffic. Serving frameworks like Triton and TorchServe, combined with intelligent load balancing, ensure that LLMs remain fast, reliable, and cost-effective for thousands of users at once.
