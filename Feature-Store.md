[Feast](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/12/16/improve-rag-retrieval-training-feast-kubeflow-trainer)
Feast is an open source feature store that provides a centralized, consistent, and scalable way to manage machine learning features. It acts as a bridge between data sources and ML models, ensuring that the features used for training match those used for inference. This consistency prevents data skew and improves model performance.

Key benefits of Feast include:

- Feature versioning: Track changes to features over time.
- Online/offline consistency: Ensures features are consistent between training and serving.
- Scalability: Handles large volumes of data and feature requests.
- Discoverability: Makes it easy for data scientists to find and reuse features.
