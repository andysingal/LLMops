Motia is a modern backend framework that unifies APIs, background jobs, events, and AI agents into a single cohesive system. Eliminate runtime complexity and build unified backends where JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc, work together in event-driven workflows, with built-in state management, observability, and one-click deployments.
