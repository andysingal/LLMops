- The first step is to have a clear vision of what we want to create and why it’s valuable to build it(we can feed the skeleton of our main idea to the LLM Twin and let it do the grunt work).It helps you do the following:

- Create your brand
- Automate the writing process
- Brainstorm new creative ideas

The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following:

1. What data we collect
2. How we preprocess the data
3. How we feed the data into the LLM
4. How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results
5. How we evaluate the generated content


An MVP is a powerful strategy because of the following reasons:

- Accelerated time-to-market: Launch a product quickly to gain early traction
- Idea validation: Test it with real users before investing in the full development of the product
- Market research: Gain insights into what resonates with the target audience
- Risk minimization: Reduces the time and resources needed for a product that might not achieve market success

### feature/training/inference (FTI) 
Building production-ready ML systems is much more than just training a model. From an engineering point of view, training the model is the most straightforward step in most use cases. However, training a model becomes complex when deciding on the correct architecture and hyperparameters. That’s not an engineering problem but a research problem.

At this point, we want to focus on how to design a production-ready architecture. Training a model with high accuracy is extremely valuable, but just by training it on a static dataset, you are far from deploying it robustly. We have to consider how to do the following:

- Ingest, clean, and validate fresh data
- Training versus inference setups
- Compute and serve features in the right environment
- Serve the model in a cost-effective way
- Version, track, and share the datasets and models
- Monitor your infrastructure and models
- Deploy the model on a scalable infrastructure
- Automate the deployments and training

## ML pipelines
**** we have the feature, training, and inference pipelines

#### The feature pipeline
The feature pipeline takes raw data as input, processes it, and outputs the features and labels required by the model for training or inference. Instead of directly passing them to the model, the features and labels are stored inside a feature store. Its responsibility is to store, version, track, and share the features. By saving the features in a feature store, we always have a state of our features. Thus, we can easily send the features to the training and inference pipelines.

As the data is versioned, we can always ensure that the training and inference time features match. Thus, we avoid the training-serving skew problem.


#### The training pipeline
The training pipeline takes the features and labels from the features stored as input and outputs a train model or models. The models are stored in a model registry. Its role is similar to that of feature stores, but this time, the model is the first-class citizen. Thus, the model registry will store, version, track, and share the model with the inference pipeline.

Also, most modern model registries support a metadata store that allows you to specify essential aspects of how the model was trained. The most important are the features, labels, and their version used to train the model. Thus, we will always know what data the model was trained on.


#### The inference pipeline
The inference pipeline takes as input the features and labels from the feature store and the trained model from the model registry. With these two, predictions can be easily made in either batch or real-time mode.
