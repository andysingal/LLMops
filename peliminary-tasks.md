- The first step is to have a clear vision of what we want to create and why itâ€™s valuable to build it(we can feed the skeleton of our main idea to the LLM Twin and let it do the grunt work).It helps you do the following:

- Create your brand
- Automate the writing process
- Brainstorm new creative ideas

The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following:

1. What data we collect
2. How we preprocess the data
3. How we feed the data into the LLM
4. How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results
5. How we evaluate the generated content


An MVP is a powerful strategy because of the following reasons:

- Accelerated time-to-market: Launch a product quickly to gain early traction
- Idea validation: Test it with real users before investing in the full development of the product
- Market research: Gain insights into what resonates with the target audience
- Risk minimization: Reduces the time and resources needed for a product that might not achieve market success
