[Dapr Agents: A Framework for Agentic AI Systems](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents)

Dapr Agents is a developer framework designed to build production-grade resilient AI agent systems that operate at scale. Built on top of the battle-tested Dapr project, it enables software developers to create AI agents that reason, act, and collaborate using Large Language Models (LLMs), while leveraging built-in observability and stateful workflow execution to guarantee agentic workflows complete successfully, no matter how complex.
