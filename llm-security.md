[LlamaFirewall](https://www.xugj520.cn/en/archives/ai-security-framework-llamafirewall.html)

LlamaFirewall is an open-source security-focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI agents. Unlike traditional moderation tools that mainly focus on filtering toxic content, LlamaFirewall provides system-level defenses tailored to modern agentic use cases, such as code generation, tool orchestration, and autonomous decision-making. It consists of a set of scanners for different security risks, including PromptGuardScanner, AlignmentCheckScanner, CodeShieldScanner, and customizable regex filters.
