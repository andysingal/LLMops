An agent in the context of LLM orchestration is an intelligent controller that: 

- Receives a goal or task (for example, answer a user question, analyze a dataset, book a meeting on my calendar)
- Dynamically decides which actions to take next (which tools or subroutines to call) based on the current context and the outputs of previous steps
- Monitors its own progress, and re-planning as necessary
