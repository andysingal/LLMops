[Masking of Sensitive LLM Data](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/masking)

Masking is a feature that allows precise control over the tracing data sent to the Langfuse server. With custom masking functions, you can control and sanitize the data that gets traced and sent to the server.

[Evaluating Multi-Turn Conversations](https://langfuse.com/guides/cookbook/example_simulated_multi_turn_conversations)

In this cookbook we’ll cover how to use agents that simulate a user having a conversation with your chatbot, and measure the output of these conversations. We’ll cover:

- Creating structured datasets of features to test, scenarios, personas…
- Using OpenEvals to simulate a specific use-case.
- Running the simulations against the production application
- Evaluating the output of the simulation with an LLM-as-a-Judge.
